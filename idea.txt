NYE Video Party

End Goal: each year we host a NYE party with a long compilation video, featuring one music video per year, synced to end at midnight.

Engineering summary: use [Remotion](https://remotion.dev) to compile a folder full of videos into a single final video with timeclock.

How: the files will have specific titles and follow a predefined build pattern. The final video will be built from:

- music videos (a single music video per year)
- bumps (optional: multiple random clips and found footage, to be shuffled)
- transitions: (optional: short abstract clips, to be used between EVERY cut, shuffled)
- titles (optional: yearly titles with written and spoken year)

Each year in the final video will follow this format:

- title, transition, bump[s], transition, music video, transition

Folder structure:

/music
 - 1984-music-video-title.mp4
